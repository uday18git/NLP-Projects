# Trigram Model for Natural Language Processing
This project is an implementation of a trigram language model for natural language processing tasks. 
The trigram model is used to estimate the probability of a word given the two preceding words in a sentence.

## Introduction
The trigram model is a statistical language model that uses the conditional probability of a word given its two preceding words to estimate the probability of a sentence.
The model is based on the Markov assumption, which assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the previous two words in a sentence.
