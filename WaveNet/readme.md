# WaveNet
WaveNet is a deep neural network-based model that can be used for generating names or other sequences of text. 
It was introduced by Google DeepMind in 2016 and has been widely used for various text generation tasks, including speech synthesis, music generation, and natural language generation.
At a high level, WaveNet is an autoregressive model that generates text one token at a time, conditioned on the previous tokens in the sequence. 
It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, where the convolutional layers are dilated, meaning that the filters have gaps between them, 
allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies in the data.
