# Natural Language Processing Models
This repository contains a collection of natural language processing models, including trigram and multi-layer perceptron models. 
These models are designed to be used for a variety of NLP tasks, such as language modeling, text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
## Models
### Trigram Model
The trigram model is a language model that predicts the next word in a sequence based on the two previous words. It uses a simple probability-based approach to generate text that mimics the style and structure of the input text.

To use the trigram model, you need to provide a text file as input. The model will generate new text based on the patterns it discovers in the input text. You can adjust the complexity of the generated text by modifying the smoothing factor and other parameters.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron Model
The multi-layer perceptron model is a neural network that can be used for text classification and other NLP tasks. It uses multiple layers of neurons to learn complex patterns in the input data and make predictions based on those patterns.

To use the multi-layer perceptron model, you need to provide a dataset of labeled text documents as input. The model will learn to classify the documents based on their content and assign them to one or more predefined categories.
